An implementation of [ISO/IEC Technical Specification 21425:2017 "Programming languages -- C++ Extensions for ranges"](https://www.iso.org/standard/70910.html) (the "Ranges TS").
Compilation requires a compiler with support for C++17 and the Concepts TS, which as of this writing means [GCC 6+](https://gcc.gnu.org/) with the `-std=c++1z` and `-fconcepts` command line options.
